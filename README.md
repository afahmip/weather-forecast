# Weather Forecast App  

## OpenWeatherMap API
 
In this project, I'm using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). **But what is an API?**

Basically an API (Application Programming Interface) is

> a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software - Wikipedia

It is part of the server that receives requests and sends responses as the way to serve customers. It helps user to ask for needed data from a certain server, software, etc.

This OpenWeatherMap API is also the same. Users can ask for certain weather data to its web server, then, the server will return certain data related to the user's needs. Basically the data sent is not in the format of natural language, rather it's in a form of XML, JSON, etc. We can ask for some data from OpenWeatherMap API, such as
- Current Weather data
- 5 day / 3 hour forecast
- 16 day / daily forecast
- HIstorical data
- etc. You can see the list [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
